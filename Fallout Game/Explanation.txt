Here, we have created a website using Html and Css as a simulation of popular hacking mini game from Fallout.
It creates a 4 digit code using random digits from 0 to 5 (each digit used only once).
It allows user 5 attempts to try and guess the code.
The result is a combination of characters O, X and V
WHERE:-
O - correct digit in correct place,
X - wrong digit,
V - correct digit in wrong place.
e.g. In this code, the Given code's value is assumed to be = 3251.

    "5 ATTEMPTS LEFT...",
    "CODE : 1234",
    "SYS  : VOVX",
    "4 ATTEMPTS LEFT...",
    "CODE : 3215",
    "SYS  : OOVV",
    "3 ATTEMPTS LEFT...",
    "CODE : 3251",
    "SYS  : OOOO",
    "SUCCESS"
